fn1. are only necessary for executing the @rakefile@ which runs the unit tests and generates test and code coverage reports. Otherwise, the basic requirements are enough.

h2. File Structure

Each item at level 1 in the following list represents a component of the framework. Each item at level 2 indicates a source file containing part of the implementation of the corresponding component. Those files are stored in the @src/@ directory (see *Git Repository* for more information about the file structure).

All components, except the Libraries, have a façade file in case they consist on several files. Just importing (@require@) the façade is sufficient for accessing all the logic implemented by the component. Façades are labelled <sup>f</sup>. It is usually the case that they have the same name as the component.

Since the code is thoroughly unit tested, most classes have their RSpec counterpart in the @spec/@ directory. When this is the case, files are labelled <sup>s</sup>.

* Property: property abstraction
** @property@<sup>f</sup>
** @property_class@<sup>s</sup>: @Property@ class definition (property namespace)
** @property_core@: @Property@ instances definition
** @property_ast@: AST for representing a simplified view of predicates
** @property_rcollector@: @ResultCollector@ stores subexpression results of instrumented predicates
** @property_pvisitor@: @PropertyVisitor@ instruments @Properties@ and builds a simplied AST
** @property_covervisitor@: @CoverVisitor@ computes property coverage goals
** @property_covertable@: @CoverTable@ stores property coverage
** @property_language@: DSL for defining properties

* Libraries
** @decorator@<sup>s</sup>: Decorator design pattern
** @initializer@<sup>s</sup>: Facility for simplified constructors, à la CLOS
** @visitable@<sup>s</sup>: Visitor design pattern
