h2. Requirements

* "Ruby 1.8":http://www.ruby-lang.org/
* "Ruby Gems":http://www.rubygems.org/
** "ParseTree":http://github.com/seattlerb/parsetree/
** "rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/ <sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

fn1. are only necessary for executing the @rakefile@ which runs the unit tests and generates test and code coverage reports. Otherwise, the basic requirements are enough.

h2. File Structure

Each item at level 1 in the following list represents a component of the framework. Each item at level 2 indicates a source file containing part of the implementation of the corresponding component. Those files are stored in the @src/@ directory (see *Git Repository* for more information).

All components, except the Libraries, have a façade file in case they consist on several files. Just importing (@require@) the façade is sufficient for accessing all the logic implemented by the component. Façades are labelled <sup>f</sup>. It is usually the case that they have the same name as the component.

Since the code is thoroughly unit tested, most classes have their RSpec counterpart in the @spec/@ directory. When this is the case, files are labelled <sup>s</sup>.

* Property: property abstraction
** @property@ <sup>f</sup>
** @property_class@ <sup>s</sup>: @Property@ class definition (property namespace)
** @property_core@ <sup>s</sup>: @Property@ instances definition
** @property_ast@: AST for representing a simplified view of predicates
** @property_rcollector@ <sup>s</sup>: @ResultCollector@ stores subexpression results of instrumented predicates
** @property_pvisitor@ <sup>s</sup>: @PropertyVisitor@ instruments @Properties@ and builds a simplied AST
** @property_covervisitor@ <sup>s</sup>: @CoverVisitor@ computes property coverage goals
** @property_covertable@ <sup>s</sup>: @CoverTable@ stores property coverage
** @property_language@ <sup>s</sup>: DSL for defining properties

* Pipeline
** @pipeline@
** @plist@
** @action@

* Libraries
** @decorator@ <sup>s</sup>: Decorator design pattern
** @initializer@ <sup>s</sup>: Facility for simplified constructors, à la CLOS
** @visitable@ <sup>s</sup>: Visitor design pattern
